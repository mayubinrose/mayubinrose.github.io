Using game elements in non-game contexts
1.Game elements:A toolkit for building a game
Objects,relationships among objects ,abstract concepts embedding rules...
2.Game-design techniques:How to make the overall gamified experience greater than the sum of these parts?
Points,badges,leaderboards
3.Non-game contexts
*** Internal , External and Behavioral change ***
Internal gamification:

```

## Six steps to design gamification
A good design process melds **creativity** and **structure** to match people’s needs with **technical** feasibility and **business** realities.
1.Define objectives
List objectives=>Rank objectives and trade off goals=>Delete machnics or the means to an end=>Jusitify objectives
2.Delineate target behaviors
Target behaviors should be concrete and specific:
• Sign up for an account on your website
• Post a comment on a discussion board
• Exercise for at least 30 minutes
• Share information about your service on Twitter
• Comment or vote on suggestions by others.
The behaviors you are looking for should promote the
ultimate business objectives you previously defined,
though the relationship may be indirect.
3.Define your players
Killers ,Achievers,Socializers and Explorers.
Mind the fact that your players are growing up.
4.Devise activity cycles
• Engagement loops:
At a micro level, what your players do, why they do
it, and what the system does in response.
• Progression stairs:
Give a macro perspective on the player’s journey.

6.Deploy the appropriate tools
You
need a team:
• People who understand the business goals of the project
• An understanding of your target group of players and the basics of
psychology,
• Game designers
• Analytics experts able to make sense of the data your gamified systems
generates
• Technologists able to implement your vision.
